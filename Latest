### 1. Introduction

In this document, I outline the steps required to migrate our Oracle database for the FPA project to Google Cloud SQL using Microsoft SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle. This process aims to ensure a smooth transition to a cloud-based environment, leveraging the capabilities of GCP.

### 2. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- An accessible Oracle database instance with the necessary permissions.
- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with billing enabled.
- A Google Cloud SQL instance set up and configured.
- Microsoft SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle installed.
- Credentials for both Oracle and Google Cloud SQL databases.
- Stable internet connectivity for accessing cloud resources.
- Familiarity with the FPA project's Java 17 and Tomcat 10.1 setup.

### 3. Setting Up the Environment

1. **Install SSMA for Oracle:**
   - Download and install SSMA for Oracle from the Microsoft website.

2. **Prepare the Oracle Database:**
   - Ensure the Oracle database is accessible and that I have the necessary permissions to perform the migration.

3. **Set Up Google Cloud SQL:**
   - Create a new Cloud SQL instance in the Google Cloud Console.
   - Configure the instance settings, including networking, users, and database settings.

### 4. Step-by-Step Migration Guide

#### 4.1 Install SSMA for Oracle

1. **Download and Install:**
   - Download SSMA for Oracle from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54258).
   - Follow the installation instructions to set it up on my machine.

#### 4.2 Connect to Oracle Database

1. **Launch SSMA for Oracle:**
   - Open SSMA for Oracle.

2. **Create a New Project:**
   - Go to `File` > `New Project`.
   - Enter the project name (e.g., FPA) and location.
   - Select the target SQL Server/Azure SQL Database version.

3. **Connect to Oracle:**
   - Click `Connect to Oracle` in the toolbar.
   - Enter the Oracle server name, credentials, and SID/Service name.
   - Click `Connect`.

#### 4.3 Set Up Google Cloud SQL

1. **Create a Cloud SQL Instance:**
   - Go to the Google Cloud Console.
   - Navigate to `SQL` > `Create instance`.
   - Select the database engine (PostgreSQL or MySQL, since SQL Server is not natively supported by Cloud SQL).
   - Configure the instance with the required settings.

2. **Configure Network and Security:**
   - Set up authorized networks to allow connections from my local machine and any other necessary sources.
   - Create and configure database users.

#### 4.4 Connect to Google Cloud SQL

Since SSMA primarily supports SQL Server, I'll need an intermediate step for compatibility.

1. **Intermediate SQL Server Instance:**
   - Use an intermediate SQL Server instance to facilitate the migration from Oracle to Google Cloud SQL.

2. **Connect to SQL Server:**
   - In SSMA, click `Connect to SQL Server` in the toolbar.
   - Enter the server name, authentication method, and credentials.
   - Click `Connect`.

#### 4.5 Assess the Oracle Database

1. **Assess Database Objects:**
   - Select the Oracle schemas and objects I want to migrate.
   - Right-click the selected objects and choose `Add to Project`.

2. **Run Assessment:**
   - Click `Assess` in the toolbar.
   - Review the assessment results to identify potential issues and required changes.

#### 4.6 Convert the Schema

1. **Convert Schema:**
   - Click `Convert Schema` in the toolbar.
   - SSMA will generate the SQL Server-compatible schema.

2. **Review and Apply Schema:**
   - Review the generated schema for any necessary adjustments.
   - Click `Synchronize` to apply the schema to the intermediate SQL Server instance.

3. **Export Schema from SQL Server:**
   - Export the schema from the SQL Server instance.

4. **Import Schema to Cloud SQL:**
   - Use the appropriate tools (e.g., Cloud SQL import functionality) to import the schema into Google Cloud SQL.

#### 4.7 Migrate Data

1. **Migrate Data to SQL Server:**
   - Click `Migrate Data` in the toolbar.
   - Select the tables and data I want to migrate.
   - Start the data migration process to the intermediate SQL Server instance.

2. **Export Data from SQL Server:**
   - Export the data from the SQL Server instance.

3. **Import Data to Cloud SQL:**
   - Use the appropriate tools to import the data into Google Cloud SQL.

#### 4.8 Validate the Migration

1. **Validate Data:**
   - Compare the source Oracle data with the target Google Cloud SQL data to ensure accuracy.
   - Perform application testing with the FPA project to verify that the migrated database works as expected.

### 5. Post-Migration Steps

1. **Update Connection Strings:**
   - Update the FPA project's connection strings to point to the new Google Cloud SQL database.

2. **Performance Tuning:**
   - Optimize the Google Cloud SQL database for performance.
   - Use indexing, query optimization, and other performance enhancements.

3. **Backup and Monitoring:**
   - Set up regular backups for the new database.
   - Implement monitoring and alerting to maintain database health.

### 6. Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues:**
  - Verify network connectivity and firewall settings.
  - Ensure correct database credentials.

- **Schema Conversion Errors:**
  - Review SSMA assessment reports for details on conversion issues.
  - Manually adjust schema objects as needed.

- **Data Migration Issues:**
  - Check SSMA logs for data migration errors.
  - Ensure data types are compatible between Oracle and Google Cloud SQL.

### 7. Conclusion

Migrating an Oracle database to Google Cloud SQL using SSMA for Oracle and an intermediate SQL Server instance is a systematic process that involves assessment, schema conversion, and data migration. By following this guide, I can ensure a smooth migration with minimal downtime and data integrity, allowing the FPA project to continue running seamlessly on GCP.
